# Lung Cancer Prediction
This project aims to provide a simple and accessible tool for predicting lung cancer risk based on a variety of patient characteristics. Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly a Generalized Linear Model (GLM), the API accepts input parameters such as gender, age, smoking status, presence of symptoms, and other relevant factors to generate predictions. Developed using the R programming language and the Plumber package for creating RESTful APIs, the Lung Cancer Risk Prediction API offers a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals and researchers to assess and stratify lung cancer risk in patients. By enabling quick and accurate risk assessments, this tool contributes to early detection and personalized treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes and supporting more informed clinical decision-making.
